						Programming Assignment 3 - Trains and Roller Coasters

						The "main file" and entry point for the train project
						this basically opens up the window and starts up the world

	  Note:			this code is meant to serve as both the example solution, 
						as well as the starting point for student projects. 
						Therefore, some (questionable)
						design tradeoffs have been made - please see the 
						ReadMe-Initial.txt file
